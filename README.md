# project abstract
This project aims to train and choose an optimal policy for a self-driving car in a grid-plan city by reward and punishment. It examines the role of states, actions, rewards, models, and policy in a simplified world that characterises driving in a modern urban city. We applied the reinforcement learning methods to help the car effectively reach its destinations in the allotted time. By constructing a basic driving implementation based on random actions, we first explored the environment the agent operates in. Then we identified the possible states the agent could encounter such as oncoming cars and traffic lights at every intersection and build the self-driving agent. To create a smart car, the Q-Learning algorithm was implemented, which guides the car towards its destination within limited time. With stochastic action selection, the parameters were tested to produce an optimal policy.
